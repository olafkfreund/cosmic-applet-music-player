## Troubleshooting

### Applet not appearing in panel
- Ensure the applet is properly installed: `which cosmic-ext-applet-music-player` should return a path
- Try restarting COSMIC™ or logging out/in
- Check COSMIC™ Settings → Desktop → Panel → Configure panel applets

### No players showing in Settings
- Click "Discover Players" to scan for available players
- Ensure your music player is running and supports MPRIS
- Try restarting your music player

### Applet not controlling music
- Check that the correct player is selected in Settings tab
- Ensure the selected player is currently running
- Some players may need to be playing music before they appear

### No album artwork
- Album artwork depends on the music player providing image URLs
- Some players may not provide artwork through MPRIS
- Local files may not have embedded artwork

### Mouse shortcuts not working
- Ensure you're hovering directly over the applet icon
- Check that no other application is intercepting mouse events

### Settings not saving
- Check file permissions in `~/.config/cosmic/`
- Ensure the directory exists and is writable

## Building Requirements

The following system packages are required for building:

- `libdbus-1-dev` (for MPRIS D-Bus communication via mpris crate)
- `pkg-config` (for dependency detection)
- `libssl-dev` (for HTTPS requests via reqwest crate for album artwork)
- `build-essential` or equivalent (C compiler for native dependencies)

### Ubuntu/Debian:
```bash
sudo apt install libdbus-1-dev pkg-config libssl-dev build-essential
```

### Fedora/RHEL:
```bash
sudo dnf install dbus-devel pkgconfig openssl-devel gcc
```

### Arch Linux:
```bash
sudo pacman -S dbus pkg-config openssl base-devel
```

### openSUSE:
```bash
sudo zypper install dbus-1-devel pkg-config libopenssl-devel gcc
```
